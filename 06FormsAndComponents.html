				<h2 class="subtitle">Shop Page</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We start by creating a dir shop/ in our pages/ dir, and create a shop.compnent.tsx file and a shop.data.js file for the data of our state. We import React and SHOP_DATA and create a class component <code>class ShopPage extends React.Component { ... }</code> in the constructor we need props for some reason, and we call <code>constructor(props:any){ super(props); this.state ={ collections: SHOP_DATA } }</code> then we just <code>render() { return ...div }</code> just to see if we connected. We export the component and then import it into App.tsx. Then we change our second Route component inside our Switch to <code>path='/shop'</code> and <code>component={ShopPage}</code> and if we go to that URL we get the Shop Page. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>CollectionPreview Component</strong>
					<br>
					We create a component to display our items. We create the folder and files for it in our components/ dir. Here we do the standard imports for our components and create a Fn component <code>const CollectionPreview: React.FC = ( ... ) => { ... }</code> where we will render a div with className collection-preview and inside an h1 className title, and another div className preview. We want to pass two things as props, a title for our H1 and items for our items. I create <code>interface CollectionPreviewProps { title: string, items: any[] }</code> to code-along in the mean time, and pass it as a generic for our React.FC component. We use <code>{ title.toUpperCase() }</code> in our h1, and <code>{ items.map( item => ... ) }</code> which renders a div with <code>key={item.id}</code> and the <code>{ item.name }</code> inside of the div. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>Shop Component</strong>
					<br>
					We import our new CollectionPreview Component into our ShopPage component. We go to render() and destructure our collections from the state <code>const { collections } = this.state</code> which we will use to map our CollectionPreview component. We go to our return and inside the className shop-page dive do <code>{ collections.map()... }</code> where we want to get the data we want from the collecitons arr with destructuring <code>({id, ...otherCollectionProps}) => ( ... )</code>. We don't have TS support because we don't have typecasting for the state we are passing. I created a <code>interface ShopPageState { ... }</code> that we will use as a generic for our React.Component. I hover over SHOP_DATA and copy the TS inferred type and add it into our interface <code>collections: { ... }</code> which will match what our state is. In a React.Component we need to pass two things as generics, the <em>props</em> that we will pass, and the <em>state</em>, so we do <code>any, ShopPageState</code>. Having done that we get TS support and no errs on our code. We can now proceed to render the component. We render a <code>CollectionPreview key={id} {...otherCollectionProps}</code> which will send all the values from a SHOP_DATA items to the component. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>Back to CollectionPreview</strong>
					<br>
					I update the CollectionPreviewProps interface with the typing of Items form SHOP_DATA. This gives us TS support for the destrucutred title, items in our props. Now we do two transformations to our items <code>.filter(_, index)=> index < 4)</code> and <code>.map(item=> ... )</code> where we render a div for each item <code>div key={item.id}</code> and <code>{ item.name }</code> inside the div. Now we load our page and we see that we get the first for items of every category of our data, just how we want it. <strong>Note:</strong> Yihua goes into performance due to all the transformations we are doing and that we will se a workaround in the future.
				</p>
				<a id="02" href="#00">Index</a>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Collection Item</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We create a new component with the same Jazz as always, dir, and files. We import our default imports. We create a Fn component <code>const CollectionItem</code> which I will go ahead and export for TS satiety. Here we will get what we pass from our CollectionPreview component as props when we use it. We will get what is in each item of our SHOP_DATA so I create an interface <code>interface CollectionItemProps { ... }</code> with typing for that. I pass it to our React.FC component as a generic and then we destructure it in our props with TS support <code>({ id, name, price, imageUrl }) => ( ... )</code> Inside we create a parent div className collection-item. Inside we create a div for the image like we did before: className image and <code>style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})` }}</code>  which we get from the props. Then we create a sibling div className collection-footer that has two spans of className name and price and we pass the values in for name and price. We have the component ready to go. Then we import our style for the component where we can see how they are placed, which is not gone into with much detail. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>CollectionPreview</strong>
					<br>
					We import CollectionItem from our components and then change what we render from our .map() to be CollectionItem. Here we want to pass the props from the item we are mapping through so we destructure <code>({ id, ...otherItemProps })</code> which we pass <code>CollectionItem key={ id } { ...otherItemProps }</code> which will send what we want. <strong>Note:</strong> I removed ID from the interface in Collection Item as it collides with the prop we are actually sending, which is key. We then copy the styles for CollectionPreview and now we get what we want. 4 rows, one for each category, then inside the rows, 4 collectionItems with image, name, and price. Now we import the style and add padding in our App.css file, and we are done, everything is working and looking as expected. 
				</p>
				<a id="03" href="#00">Index</a>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Header Component</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We start by the usual for a Header component. We create a React.FC Header with a div className header, and we <code>import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'</code> which we use inside our div. We will use a logo that is provided in SVG format (Scalable Vector Graphics). These are really small, really performant images that look the same no matter how large or how small the image is expanded. We place it into an assets/ dir, and then import it with a special React syntax for SVG <code>import { ReactComponent as Logo } from '../../assets/crown.svg'</code> Which now lets us use the Logo component in our Header. We set it inside our Link tag className logo-container as <code>Logo className='logo'</code>. Then we create a div className options for our other links, and create two Link components inside with className option and to='/shop' and /contact. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>Always visible</strong>
					<br>
					We import Header into our App component and then set it outside of our Switch Component, right over it, which means that it will <em>always render</em> regardless of what happens with our routes and Router. A lot easier than EJS... We copy the styles into our header styles and we have our header complete, where the logo is 28px wide, and the options take 50% of the flex container. However we have the standard a tag undeline which we remove in our App.css with <code>a { text-decoration: none; color: black; }</code> We do this so that any a tag we use from now on doesn't have this styling, but we could have done it in our scss file. 
				</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Sign In Page and SignIn Component</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We create a SingInAndSignUpPage component, Yihua is not great at naming. We do the default and create a React.FC component and then import it to our App component and use a Route with path /signin to render it. We create a component sign-in with all the usual. We make this a <code>class SignIn extends React.Component { ... }</code> we set the generics to <code>any, SignInState</code> using a custom interface <code>interface SignInState { [key: string]: string }</code> which can take multiple props with keys that are strings and values that are string. We call the constructor <code>constructor(props: any) { super(props); this.state = { email = '', password: '' } }</code>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>SignIn Component</strong>
					<br>
					We do our render() inside we create a parent div className sign-in with an h2 'I already have an Account' and a span 'Sign in with your email and password'. Then we create a from element with no attributes. Inside we create an input <code>input name='email' type='email' value={ this.state.email } required</code> whch uses HTML standard attributes. Then we create a label. We do the same for password but we change to <code>this.state.password</code>. Once we have that we want to handle our submit and prevent it from triggering the default HTML behaviour. We create a function in our class <code>handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt;) => { ... }</code> which I took the type from the <code>onSubmit={}</code> I added to the form. <strong>Note:</strong> you can find the appropriate types by hovering over and it will get you the TS support you need. We <code>event.prevetDefault(); this.setState({ email: '', password: '' })</code> which will reset our fields when we submit without triggering the HTML form default behaviour of sending an HTTP request. Then we call this method on our form <code>onSubmit= { this.handleSubmit }</code>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>onChange and handleChange()</strong>
					<br>
					We want to change our state when the user types into any of our inputs. We have done this before in monster rolodex with the onChange attribute that triggerst a React SyntheticEvent that returns an event object with all the changes that occured in the element. We create a function <code>handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;) => { ... }</code> Inside we destructure our event <code>const { name, value } = event.target</code> which TS undrstands and supports fully. Then we use them to set our state <code>this.setState({ [name]: value })</code> which creates properties in our state based on the name of the input and the value. This is why I had to set the interface as I did, I could not get TS to support explicit props. We then import the SignIn component to our Sign in page and place it inside our div and we have everything set. We see that everything works as expected and that onSubmit the values are cleared.
				</p>
				<a id="04" href="#00">Index</a>
				<h2 class="subtitle">FormInput Component</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We create a new React.FC component FormInput. It will take the props necessary to create our input, we destructure them <code>({ handleChange, label, ...otherProps })</code> and it will render a div className group, and inside an input <code>className='form-input' onChange={ handleChange } {...otherProps}</code> which will create what we want. Then inside we have an optional value in our props <code>label</code> so we create a ternary operator <code>label? ...renderLogic... : null</code> to render a label tag if we have a label in our props. The label has <code>className={`${otherProps.value.length ? 'shrink' : ''} form-input-label`}</code> which will add the class shrink if we have a value string with a lenght over 0, and will always have the class form-input label' 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>Styling</strong>
					<br>
					We copy over the styles for formInput and we have something new <code>$sub-color: grey; $main-color: black;</code> which is a SASS variable, which allows us to call that value in our file using <code>$sub-color</code>, this allows us to change a color all over a file without having to individually change the value. We have another new thing <code>@mixin shrinkLabel { ... }</code> which is a mixin that has 3 lines of css code. We can now include this whole block of code where we call it with <code>@include shrinkLabel()</code>. They are basically re-usable blocks of css, or css objects, where variables are primitives. We also have <code>&:focus ~ .form-input-label { ... }</code> This line of code means that when we focus <em>set our writing cursos in the input</em> on the form-input-label class, we apply a style, in this case <code>@include shrinkLabel()</code>. shrinkLabel moves the input up, changese the font-size and the color. We also have a transition of 300ms so that when the properties in shrinkLabel are applied, they take 300ms to change, giving us an animation.  
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>Adding to SignIn Component</strong>
					<br>
					We import it to our SignIn Component and replace the Input tags with our custo FormInput Component. We change onChange to <code>handleChange={ ... }</code> which is the prop that we are passing to the FormInput component. And we add the label prop as email and password. Now we go to typing the component properly. We are passing props to the FormInput component but we have no TS support and we get errs. I create <code>interface FormInputProps { ... }</code> that has all the props we pass. There are two details the first one is <code>handleChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void</code> where I took the definition of our function from the hover over. And <code>label?: string;</code> because we have all the code set up to expect an optional label property. I pass this interface as a generic for our React.FC. In our signIn component we remove the label because we are creating int in our FormInput directly. Now we save and we can see our new styled form inputs. One minor detail is that we set the width of the div className sign-in to be 30wh so it doesn't go through the whole screen.
				</p>
				<a id="05" href="#00">Index</a>
				<h2 class="subtitle">CustomButton Component</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We are creating a FormInput and CustomButtom components so that we can handle every need for an input and a button wherever our app may need it in the future. We want a very flexible button, and we will add functionality and flexibility as we grow into needing it to see how the workflow would be. Our component is a React.FC component, and it will render a button of className custom-button. We will pass a few props <code>({ children, ...otherProps })</code> where children is anything that goes inside our CustomButton tag. It is supported by default as type <code>children: React.ReactNode</code> and ...otherProps will be what gives us other information about how the button should work, mainly type as submit. So we create the <code>interface CustomButtonProps { children: React.ReactNode; type?: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset' }</code> I added the types for type straight form the button element in our Component when I got an err. We use ? since we don't always get this prop, and we set the string literals to the types that button can take. This will stop the TS err.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					<strong>SignIn integration</strong>
					<br>
					We import the CustomButton component from our file and then change the button in the bottom with CustomButton, where we have a complete tag that holds Sign in inside it, which will be treated as the childern. We copy the style and there is nothing magical about it. This time we use <code>text-transform: uppercase</code> instead of doing it in our template with JS. Now that we have this, we have our button looking as intended and replacing our old button but still leaving room for customization. We then add some styling to the SignIn component <code>display: flex; flex-direction: column;</code> and to the nested title className element a margin of 10px.
